### Breaking changes
- The field``CreateAutonomousDatabaseDetails`` is no longer an anonymous field and the type changed from struct to interface in struct ``CreateAutonomousDatabaseRequest``. Here is sample code that shows how to update your code to incorporate this change. 

    - Before

    ```golang
    // create a CreateAutonomousDatabaseRequest
    // There were two ways to initialize the CreateAutonomousDatabaseRequest struct.
    // This breaking change only impact option #2
    request := database.CreateAutonomousDatabaseRequest{}

    // #1. Instantiate CreateAutonomousDatabaseDetails directly: no impact
    details := database.CreateAutonomousDatabaseDetails{}
    details.CompartmentId = common.String(getCompartmentID())
    // ... other properties

    // Set it to the request class
    request.CreateAutonomousDatabaseDetails = details

    // #2. Instantiate CreateAutnomousDatabaseDetails through  anonymous fields: will break
    request.CompartmentId = common.String(getCompartmentID())
    // ... other properties
    ```

    - After

    ```golang
    // #2 no longer supported. Create CreateAutonomousDatabaseDetails directly
    details := database.CreateAutonomousDatabaseDetails{}
    details.CompartmentId = common.String(getCompartmentID())
    // ... other properties

    // and set the details to CreateAutonomousDatabaseBase
    request := database.CreateAutonomousDatabaseRequest{}
