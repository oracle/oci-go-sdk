// Package transfer simplifies interaction with the Object Storage service by abstracting away the method used
// to upload objects.  Depending on the configuration parameters, UploadManager may choose to do a single
// put_object request, or break up the upload into multiple parts and utilize multi-part uploads.
//
// An advantage of using multi-part uploads is the ability to retry individual failed parts, as well as being
// able to upload parts in parallel to reduce upload time.
//
// To use this package, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator.
