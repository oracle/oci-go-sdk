// Generative AI Service Inference API
//
// OCI Generative AI is a fully managed service that provides a set of state-of-the-art, customizable large language models (LLMs) that cover a wide range of use cases for text generation, summarization, and text embeddings.
// Use the Generative AI service inference API to access your custom model endpoints, or to try the out-of-the-box models to /EN/generative-ai-inference/latest/ChatResult/Chat, /EN/generative-ai-inference/latest/GenerateTextResult/GenerateText, /EN/generative-ai-inference/latest/SummarizeTextResult/SummarizeText, and /EN/generative-ai-inference/latest/EmbedTextResult/EmbedText.
// To use a Generative AI custom model for inference, you must first create an endpoint for that model. Use the /EN/generative-ai/latest/ to /EN/generative-ai/latest/Model/ by fine-tuning an out-of-the-box model, or a previous version of a custom model, using your own data. Fine-tune the custom model on a /EN/generative-ai/latest/DedicatedAiCluster/. Then, create a /EN/generative-ai/latest/DedicatedAiCluster/ with an Endpoint to host your custom model. For resource management in the Generative AI service, use the /EN/generative-ai/latest/.
// To learn more about the service, see the Generative AI documentation (https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/generative-ai/home.htm).
