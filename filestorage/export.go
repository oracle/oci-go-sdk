// Export A file system and the path that you can use to mount it. Each export
// resource belongs to exactly one export set.
// The export's path attribute is not a path in the
// referenced file system, but the value used by clients for the path
// component of the remotetarget argument when mounting the file
// system.
// The path must start with a slash (/) followed by a sequence of zero or more
// slash-separated path elements. For any two export resources associated with
// the same export set, except those in a 'DELETED' state, the path element
// sequence for the first export resource can't contain the
// complete path element sequence of the second export resource.
//
// For example, the following are acceptable:
//   * /example and /path
//   * /example1 and /example2
//   * /example and /example1
// The following examples are not acceptable:
//   * /example and /example/path
//   * / and /example
// Paths may not end in a slash (/). No path element can be a period (.)
// or two periods in sequence (..). All path elements must be 255 bytes or less.
// No two non-'DELETED' export resources in the same export set can
// reference the same file system.
// Use `exportOptions` to control access to an export. For more information, see
// Export Options (https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/File/Tasks/exportoptions.htm).
// **Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using the API.

	// export options that are applied to a specified
	// set of clients.
	// For each NFS request, the first `ClientOptions` option
	// in the list whose `source` attribute matches the source
	// IP address of the request is applied.

	// not be returned by `MOUNTPROC_EXPORT` calls made by the client
	// and any attempt to mount or access the file system through
	// this export will result in an error.
	// **Exports without defined `ClientOptions` are invisible to all clients.**
	// If one export is invisible to a particular client, associated file
	// systems may still be accessible through other exports on the same
	// or different mount targets.
	// To completely deny client access to a file system, be sure that the client
	// source IP address is not included in any export for any mount target
	// associated with the file system.
